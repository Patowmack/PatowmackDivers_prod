          <h3 class="text-center">Welcome to Patowmack Divers</h3>
          <p>
            Patowmack Divers is a social group of people with a common interest:
            SCUBA DIVING!! Our members are male and female, from 20s to mid 70s.
            Our diving experience ranges from recently certified to retired
            instructors from warm water photographers, to deep wreck technical
            divers, and cave divers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patowmack Divers arranges several dive trips per year to locations
            off Virginia and Maryland seashores, Outer Banks, NC, and other
            great dive sites in the United States, the Caribbean, and beyond.
            Group purchasing power allows us to enjoy discounts on charters,
            rentals, and accommodations. We are also active in preservation,
            research, and environmental protection. We take full advantage of
            the aquatic expertise in the DC metro area for speakers at our
            meetings, including such diverse topics as Underwater Archeology,
            Reef Ecology, Treasure Hunting Expeditions, and Aquarium setup and
            operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also have an annual Pasta Pigout to enjoy fresh pasta, good
            sauce, good wine, and good conversation.
          </p>

          <h4 class="text-center">Where We Dive</h4>
          <p>
            The short answer is anywhere. Club dive trips can be two divers or a
            dozen. Our recent dive trips include local quarries, West Palm
            Beach, Cozumel, Puerto Rico, Belize, St.Â Vincent, Palau, Sidapan,
            the Philipines, and Indonesia.

              Because of the bad snow in the DC area, this meeting will be Zoom
              only. Liz's friend Elizabeth will talk about supporting scuba
              divers with disabilities. Divers with challenges need special help
              and Elizabeth is a volunteer with several groups based in
              Portland, OR that work with these divers to help them enjoy our
              sport safely.
